Welcome to the Egg Depot! This is the repository for our project, an educational game about ducks intended to support our chosen charity, Ducks Unlimited (https://www.ducks.org/). We chose this charity with the intention of playing off rubber duck decoding, a commonly known analogy to those studying computer science. Our project was made with React and features a trivia-style game where users can answer questions to further their knowledge about ducks. Our goal is to expose users to the importance of duck habitat conservation while enjoying a fun game! We also hope to support Ducks Unlimited by providing the option to donate toward the charity within the game.
